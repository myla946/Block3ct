The first step to start the code is to have a blank python shell then you need to save the file
then the next thing that you need to do is start the list then you would need to add things into
the list then you would end the list. You need to create a list because you need to be able to have 
the values in the lsit then you need to sort list because you need to see what indexpostion it is at.
If you did not fallow the instruction then the code would make your computer not work and your code would
not be able to do anything with the code.
	The programe can be inproved by adding two list together so that they arn't seprate and you can search a list as just one. 
A change that i would make it to add to list together so that you search for something in just oen list 
put together. The code that i did is def newRandom():
    if len(unique_list) > 0:
        wichOne = input("Wich list do you want to search? Sorted or un-sorted?      ")
        if whichOne.lower() == "sorted":
            print(unique_list[random.randit(0, len(unique_list)-1)])
        else:
            print(myList[random.randit(0, len(myList)-1)])
    else:
        print(myList[random.randit(0, len(myList)-1)]).
	The recursive algarithum works by makeing sure that the numbers do not 
repeat over again as the same numbers.
